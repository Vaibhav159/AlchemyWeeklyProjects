# Basic Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, a sample script that deploys that contract, and an example of a task implementation, which simply lists the available accounts.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat accounts
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat clean
npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
node scripts/sample-script.js
npx hardhat help
```

Basis setup contract address -> 0x1a8F983Bc3Bc93c5F77bfEDbb16feDd74F0dD293
Contract with boots as struct -> 0x958C9906B8b7A8fc8b12470Cc625A138c72a0067
exp 1 -> 0xe889096236d63Ef6043B0EFB142EB68e33A70C0C
test 2 -> 0xE84DC1CE003b03B441dD91117fB363ba0BdE2Ca8
Final contract -> 0xE84DC1CE003b03B441dD91117fB363ba0BdE2Ca8
